## üí° Future Improvements & TODOs

- **Input Validation & Error Handling:**
  - Add robust validation for user input (loan amount, asset value, credit score) to handle invalid or empty entries gracefully.
  - Address the `// FIXME: Add input validation for decimal parsing` in `Program.cs`.
  - Add fluent validation for commands (`// TODO : Add fluent validation for this command` in `EvaluateLoanCommand.cs`).
- **Unit & Integration Tests:**
  - Continue maintaining high test coverage and add tests for error scenarios and statistics calculations.
  - Write unit tests for statistics query handler (`// TODO : Write unit tests for this handler` in `GetLoanStatisticsQueryHandler.cs`).
- **Configuration:**
  - Move business rule thresholds (e.g., LTV, credit score) to a config file or database for easier updates.
- **Persistence:**
  - Implement a proper database-backed repository (`// TODO : Implement a proper database-backed repository` in `LoanStatisticsRepository.cs`).
  - Use EF Core with DbContext (`// TODO : Use ef core with db context` in `LoanStatisticsRepository.cs`).
- **Extensibility:**
  - Use a proper rule engine for loan rules (`// TODO : Use proper rule engine` in `ILoanRule.cs`).
  - Support for additional loan types, more flexible rule composition, or plugin architecture.
- **Logging & Monitoring:**
  - Add structured logging and error reporting for production use.
- **API/Web Interface:**
  - Expose the functionality via a REST API or web UI for broader accessibility.
- **Domain Logic Review:**
  - Confirm and double-check statistics calculation logic with domain experts (`// TODO : Confirm this calculation logic with the domain experts`, `// TODO : Double check this calculation logic with the domain experts` in `GetLoanStatisticsQueryHandler.cs`).
